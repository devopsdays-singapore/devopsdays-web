Every software team writes code, but some teams produce fewer bugs than others. Every software team creates new features, but some teams develop features users love and others donâ€™t. What do high performance teams do differently, and why are team members more focused, satisfied and relaxed? They truly work together. No 10x rockstar programmer can achieve what a well rounded, enthusiastic team can.

Sven examines how the best software teams set and follow goals, integrate new members fast, ensure diversity, monitor and continually improve team health, embrace transparency, use a playbook to guide them through every phase of development and much more. He shares techniques including: bugfix rotations, OKRs, feature buddies, open demos, sanity checks and many more that help teams and team members to work more effectively together, and produce awesome results.
