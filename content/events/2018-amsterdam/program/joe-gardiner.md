Containers and Kubernetes are now the standard for handling applications and compute workloads. However, it is not clear how to containerise and operate databases. As more applications are migrated into containers and schedulers such as Kubernetes, handling state and persistent data is becoming an increasingly challenging problem.

_This is a fundamentals workshop and is suitable for beginners and intermediate Kubernetes users interested in running databases in a containerised environment._

Join Joe Gardiner for a hands-on lab based workshop introducing the fundamentals of Portworx and how it can offer enterprise storage capabilities for Kubernetes.

Agenda:

1. An introduction to Kubernetes storage, Portworx capabilities and architecture.
1. Learn how simple it is to deploy Portworx and pool your existing storage. Understand simple volume management and the pxctl tool.
1. Understand the native Kubernetes integration. Experience advanced topics such as high availability, snapshots, and object storage for cluster migrations.
1. Work through a practical use case, specifically a MongoDB deployment, and introduce real world, Day 2 challenges such as node failure.
1. Discuss best practises relating to monitoring and managing Portworx storage orchestration.
