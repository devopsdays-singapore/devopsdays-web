Modern application architectures are embracing public clouds, microservices, and container schedulers like Kubernetes and Nomad. Public clouds bring dynamic IP addresses, ephemeral infrastructure, and higher failure rates. Microservices increase the number of services running and have more complex service-to-service communication patterns. Schedulers run multiple services per machine, and dynamically schedule and move workloads.

These changes require a new approach for service discovery, how services find and communicate with each other, as well as how we secure our microservices architectures by segmenting access.

In this talk, we cover these challenges and how to solve them with Consul.
