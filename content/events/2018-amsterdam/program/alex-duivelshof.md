When IT Teams become DevOps teams and applications change continuously instead of once every two-years… Security Officers cannot stay behind right?

In this presentation I’ll share how we at Rabobank experienced the change to a DevOps or Agile organisation from an Information Security Officers point of view. Will emphasize on how we as Security Office facilitated the change to DevOps security and how we need to change our way of working to speak our customer language!
