My name is Ren√© van Osnabrugge. I work as DevOps Consultant at Xpirit. My personal motto is: "Continuous improvement!" I seek challenge in the fact that there is always a better way. I always try to push that extra step to achieve optimal results. Currently, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and DevOps is the perfect way to implement my motto. By using the right methods and tools I help organizations, departments, processes and people to improve in the field of software development.
