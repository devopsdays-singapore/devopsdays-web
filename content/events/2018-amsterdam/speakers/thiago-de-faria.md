Thiago is a proud father, mediocre guitar player, enthusiast traveller, mathematician and Statistician by formation but a Software Engineer by choice - he always loved modelling data, predicting and implementing AI products. Always worried about building ML models and making sure they are deployed to Production, he is an avid meetupâ€™s follower and always looking for the new things to test. Implementing ML algorithms, data pipelines and AI products is what he loves!
