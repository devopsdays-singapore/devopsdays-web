Matty Stratton is a DevOps Evangelist at PagerDuty, where he help dev and ops teams advance the practice of their craft and become more operationally mature. He collaborates with PagerDuty customers and industry thought leaders in the broader devops community, and his license plate actually says “DevOps”.

Matty has over 20 years experience in IT operations, ranging from large financial institutions such as JPMorganChase and internet firms, including Apartments.com. He has given presentations at ITSM focused events, ChefConf, DevOpsDays, Interop, PINK, and various local groups within the Chicagoland area. He is the founder and co-host of the popular Arrested DevOps podcast.

He lives in the Chicagoland area with his three kids, Henry, Joey, and Sophia. He also has an unhealthy obsession with *Doctor Who*, *Firefly*, and *Game of Thrones*. And whiskey (but not IPAs, never IPAs).
