I love designing and building infrastructure/platform products. I enjoy the challenge of reconciling developer experience and operations, as well as the end users goal and experience.

I have vast experience working on multidisciplinary projects. Iâ€™m an experienced developer, product architect, manager and mentor. I believe in and practice leadership without authority, I help people understand both the business context and the underlying architectural landscape.
