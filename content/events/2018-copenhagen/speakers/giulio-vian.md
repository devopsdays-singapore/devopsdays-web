Giulio's passion started with a TI-57, quickly followed by a Sinclair ZX80 and an Apple II. After obtaining of his degree and long years consulting dozens of disparate customers on Microsoft technologies, he is now focused on Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and DevOps themes; in spite of what you reading, he is still able to write working code even using up-to-the-minute editors instead of VI.
