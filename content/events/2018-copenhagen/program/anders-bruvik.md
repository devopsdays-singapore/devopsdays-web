Over the years, I have been involved in several decisions about tooling. While «it’s all about culture» is a common saying, I’m a firm believer that not only do the tools you choose form your company culture, but your culture should also be a part of the decision when you choose your toolset. That is: just because one company is successfully using a particular tool, it will not necessarily work well in your environment. In this ignite talk, I’m going to explore a few of the things you want to consider, and how your tool-decisions might have an impact on your organization.
