Many are the roads that lead to CoDe (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) Paradise- some are more bumpy than others and some have pitfalls that you should look out for.

So what are these (potential) problems and how can you address or avoid them? Fortunately, others have already gone down the CoDe roads and made some experience.

This ignite presentation is based on interviews with a handful of Danish companies done as part of the start-up phase of a research project on Continuous Software Engineering. The companies are of different sizes and range from about to initiate their CoDe journey through to one that has already arrived in Paradise.

We present a selection of the challenges, pitfalls, and bumps that we found and reflect on the approaches used to either address or avoid them. We also reveal a couple of lessons that can be learned from who is already in Paradise.
