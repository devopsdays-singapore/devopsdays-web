There are three ways to propose a topic at devopsdays:
<ul>
    <li>Getting Started: Half hour sessions for beginners in a specific domain.</li>
    <li>Advanced: Half hour sessions for experienced and forward looking attendees.</li>
    <li>Case Studies / Fail Stories: Fifteen minute sessions for people of all experience ranges where speakers share technical or cultural anecdotes where they succeeded or failed in a DevOps related domain. Failure is fun. People love to know that other people fail on occasion.</li>
