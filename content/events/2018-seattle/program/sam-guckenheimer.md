Transforming Microsoft to One Engineering System with a globally distributed 24x7x365 service on the public cloud. Weâ€™ll show you round the system that handles the load of some of the most demanding engineering teams in the world and share some stories about how they got there.

This is a seven-year story of moving to Cloud-First Development and modern DevOps practices, supporting an internal engineering organization of 75,000, while growing both the SaaS and traditional software business.

This experience report covers organizational and engineering practices in five areas: 

* Flow and Measurement of Customer Value
* Live-Site Culture
* Team Autonomy and Enterprise Alignment
* Shift-Left and Shift-Right Quality
* Managing Infrastructure as a Flexible Resource
