This talk is my hard-earned advice on how to build a positive culture, engineering or otherwise. I’ll talk about motivation, and what makes people want to work at their best. I’ll share a bit of history and some information about hiring at our organization. We’ll end with a few concrete tips you can use to make culture better at your own company.

I’ve designed to be a talk to remind leaders to think about the goal and run their organizations as well as they can.
