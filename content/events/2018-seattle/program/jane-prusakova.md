Computers and the Internet-Of-Things generate data about our every move, passing thought or feeling. There is also a comprehensive set of data on our life’s context: our whereabouts, connections, physiological state, patterns of movement, and deeply ingrained subconscious behaviors.

While that information may not be immediately visible or easy to learn from, it is created, collected and saved. Over time, the pile of data grows. The processing technologies become more sophisticated and powerful. The data that was originally “anonymous” becomes easily identifiable. And no data is ever “forgotten”.

In this session we will consider what data is being collected, the implications of cross-processing streams of data from different sources, and the power of metadata. There are no more secrets.
