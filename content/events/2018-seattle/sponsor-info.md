## Thank you for sponsoring DevOpsDays Seattle!

As you probably know, DevOpsDays is a volunteer run not-for-profit event. Our
goal is to help people learn about DevOps, and we couldn’t do it without your
support. Thank You!!

### Things you should do right away
#### Book your hotel rooms!
A lot of hotels in Seattle sell out in the spring. It’s a good idea to book any
rooms you’ll need as soon as possible. We don't have an official hotel, but there
are many in the area.

#### Register your attendees.
You’ll receive a registration code to be given to people who will be attending
on behalf of your company. Please don’t wait to have them register! We’d like to
have an accurate count as soon as possible. If you haven’t received your code
please email {{< email_organizers >}}

### Dates and Times
This year’s event is on April 24th and 25th, 2018. A more detailed schedule will
be posted soon.

* Booth set up - 7:00AM April 24th
* Registration opens - 8:00AM April 24th (you'll want to be ready to talk to people
by this time)
* Tear down - approximately 4:00PM on April 25th.

### Who to Send
Of course this is up to you, but most attendees will be practitioners. It’s
important to your success that you send people able to have practitioner level
conversations. If you’re showing off your latest product, be ready to answer
some technical questions. If you’re looking to hire people, have someone there
who works in the type of role you’re hiring for.

### Conference Format

DevOpsDays is a unique blend of presentation style talks and interactive open
discussions. The presentations are being chosen from over 200 submissions. We’re
really excited about the talks we’ll see.

The afternoons are run as open spaces. You can learn more about this format
at https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/. To make the most of your
participation it’s highly recommended that your staff participate in the open
space discussions. This is your best chance to show off how valuable you can
be to the attendees.

### Shipping
**IMPORTANT NEW INFORMATION**

We had previously shared information for a FedEx center to receive shipments.

* The onsite FedEx office **will not** be able to receive your shipments after all.
* The onsite FedEx office **will** be the best option for shipping things out.

The venue has a limited ability to accept shipments. Some things to be aware of

* **Shipments must be received on April 23rd, 2018.**
* **Please let us know how many packages you're shipping in advance**
* **The venue will not assume any liability or tracking reponsbility for your packages**
* **The venue does not have the ability to ship out afterwards.** Again, there is a FedEx office location onsite which can help with this. If you are using a service other than FedEx you'll need to make your own arrangements. They venue does not have a pick up location for any other service.

### Lead Collection
We don’t share attendee information with sponsors.

You’re welcome to ask people to share their contact information voluntarily.
It’s very common for sponsors to hold drawings for this purpose and we will have
a time at the end of day 2 to announce winners.

Most attendees will not have business cards, so you’ll want to have a way to
capture this information. Some sponsors will bring slips of paper and a
punchbowl, others will use something like Google Forms on a laptop or tablet.
