As we continue to work on improving our technology processes, there is much we can learn from the discipline of product management. I believe that by applying the techniques and approach of treating your infrastructure and service offerings as products, we can provide a more delightful experience and continuously improve.

Using principles and concepts from people like Marty Kagan and other experts in the product space, I will demonstrate applicable examples of applying the concepts of feedback, planning, and iterative improvement to practices including software delivery process, service desk response, and infrastructure as code.
