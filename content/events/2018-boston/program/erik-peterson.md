Is site reliability engineering and serverless a match made in heaven or a disaster waiting to happen? In this talk we will discuss just what is this serverless thing anyway, why it maters and what it means for building reliable systems. We will also explore each of the SRE principals such as embracing risk, service level objectives, monitoring and others and map them to their serverless counterparts to identify challenges and best practices. Finally we will make a few predictions about our serverless future and what it means for software engineering and operations as a whole.
