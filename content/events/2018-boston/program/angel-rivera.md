Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI\CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI\CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI\CD enables developer & operations teams to breakdown unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.

In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI\CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what they’ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform. The workshop will demonstrate ci\cd build configuration, code commits, commit builds, code testing and packaging. The participants will leave with a hands-on experience and understanding of what it takes to CI\CD.

I want to stress that the purpose of this workshop is NOT to advertise the CircleCI platform but it will be used as the CI\CD platform because it’s the one I’m most familiar with.
