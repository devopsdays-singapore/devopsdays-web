title: "Craft as in Beer: The Value of Community"
Type: "talk"
Speakers: ["aaron-aldrich"]

Instead of talking “Free as in beer”, let’s talk “Craft as in beer.” Not too long ago the entire beer market was set to be two companies, Anheuser-Busch and Miller-Coors, but plucky little startup brewers have not only survived, but thrived. On a similar time-scale, most software was being developed in large development houses behind closed doors. Open Source was largely thought of as an unsustainable mistake. Now, small open source projects pop up every day and even successful companies are based entirely on Open Source Software. How is this possible?

The overlap here: Building Strong Communities.

* What is the value of community?
* How can we still practice sharing if we can’t share our code?
* Where can we start building this community?
