## Workshop

In this session I will go through the process of setting up a kubernetes cluster from scratch. I will show shortly what part of kubernetes does what. After that I will step by step setup a kubernetes cluster with a HA master pair, HA dedicated etcd cluster, the use of rbac and network policies and authentication and authorization with tls certificates and openIDConnect. After the session, the participants should have a basic understanding about what kubernetes actually consists of and what you can do to safely and efficiently deploy a cluster without the need of a managed kubernetes service.
