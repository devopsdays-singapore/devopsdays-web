 Applying product management to internal platforms"" appeared on the ThoughtWorks
 technology radar late last year, but what does it mean? I was super
 excited to start as a platform product manager at the beginning of this
 year because as much as I like product, I love tech more. The past 6
 months have been a wild ride, with questions like:

 * How can we determine goals for our team? 
 * In a consumer organisation, how do we contribute when all the success metrics are end user focussed? 
 * How do we create better relationships with the rest of the tech team when they're focussed on features, and we're fighting with their fires?  
 
 I'm going to tell you my team's story, the challenges we've had along the way, and what we're doing to make our team better.Â
