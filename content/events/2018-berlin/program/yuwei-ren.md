We all have once been a junior engineer, and the struggle weâ€™ve been through faded away as we progress in our career. Have you wondered why, some managed to accelerate quickly while others seem never figure it out. I want to share the experience I have at the receiving end of mentorship, and what you can offer to set your mentee up for a successful career.
