I’m currently a student at TU Chemnitz, writing my Masters thesis on the orchestration of microservices. I’m absolutely passionate about DevOps and have been doing little than delving into the depths of it for the past 12 months. Unfortunately there are not many peers in my area who I could share experiences with but I was lucky enough to participate in the Coding Davinci OST 2018 Hackathon in Leipzig, where we could build an app that uses machine learning to classify 194 birds by their calls (https://github.com/gojibjib). We won in two categories: Best Tech and Audience Price.
