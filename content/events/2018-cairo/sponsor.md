<p><strong>Golden sponsor</strong> will get the benefits of Silver sponsor in addition to a table to distribute promotional material and interact with those interested to come visit during breaks.</p>
<p><strong>Platinum sponsor - we will have just ONE EXCLUSIVE sponsor!</strong> who will get the benefits of Gold sponsor in addition to logo on company&rsquo;s slide between breaks; 2-minutes presentation; and 2 free training tickets at specific courses offered by Software Engineering Competence Center.</p>
