In this talk we will cover why infrastructure automation is important and how to use Terraform to automate your infrastructure. 

This talk will not be AWS specific and cover the generic use cases of Terraform with concrete examples. The examples will only require basic linux server and networking knowledge. We will mostly cover simple Terraform syntax and basic usage of Terraform modules to provide reusable code for infrastructure components.
