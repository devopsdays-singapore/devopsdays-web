Amazon Web Services is the worldâ€™s largest cloud provider, and their ever-growing suit of tools are worth having in your toolkit. Of interest to devops practitioners are the Developer Tools: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. This talk will take a look at the core concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, the options available in the infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD pipeline space, and take a closer look at the features available in the AWS Developer Tools suite - how they can be used together, and separately, to improve the software development workflow.
