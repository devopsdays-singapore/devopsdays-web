There are as many different ideas about DevOps out there as there are individuals. From people who hate the term and think it's an empty buzzword to the evangelist, from people who work in a DevOps department to people who think a DevOps department misses the point entirely, it can be hard to figure out how to apply these ideas to your own organization.

I want to build the kind of IT environment that our employees brag about to their peers, that 99% of IT workers are jealous of when they hear how we work. Not what we work on, but how we work. I want to relentlessly eliminate the parts of IT jobs that suck. I'll tell you right now I'm not where I want to be, but I'm working on it.

How do you get there yourself? I can't tell you that.

But I believe the ideas behind DevOps are the key. I can try to help you with is how to think about these things and apply them to your organization. We can think about what we owe each other, between traditional IT functions, in order to build stable, reliable environments, build trust, and enable experimentation without getting out into the wilderness.
