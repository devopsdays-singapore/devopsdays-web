DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends
on your sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations,
or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have
short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the
website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are
encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with
the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo
products/projects as part of an open space session.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at
DevOpsDays on their own terms.

The following chart outlines our sponsorship packages.  Drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}} If you have questions or are interested in sponsoring.

All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open
spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will
probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the
attendees.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at
