I have been working with the various Cloud platforms, Docker, CI/CD, and various other DevOps tools for several years now. My undergraduate degree is acutally in Music Performance (primary instrument: Organ) and my masters is in Communication Studies. I started out my career as a video director/producer/editor and moved from that into streaming video delivery. From streaming I moved to UI/UX design which I did for a few years before transitioning to DevOps, which I’ve been doing ever since. Because of my unique background with UI/UX, I tend to approach DevOps problems with the attitude of making sure a solution is easy to use and that I’m not the only person who can use the solutions I create.
