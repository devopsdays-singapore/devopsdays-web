<hr>

DevOpsDays DFW is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that is made possible by local volunteers and corporate sponsorships. We do not sell product presentations, nor do we distribute attendee contact lists. This is a community event that provides an opportunity for local current practitioners and those interested in learning, to benefit from the DevOps community. 
<p>
In 2018 we will host vendors and conference attendees on August 29th for DevOpsDays B4CON. This exciting event will be held the day prior to the conference (Aug 29th) and will provide an opportunity for more authentic, casual interactions and deeper technical discussions between vendor sponsors and conference attendees.
<p>
Sponsors will have the opportunity to provide short elevator pitches during the DevOpsDays B4CON and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.
