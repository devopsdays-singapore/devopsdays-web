Programmer since 7 years old. Always like to know not just how to code things, but also 
how to make it perform reliably. Since 2005 at various roles at (todays) Trapeze Group - 
software engineer, software/system architect, build manager, SCRUM master and now DevOps 
engineer. Automated builds, tests, deployment and configuration management. Quite often 
asked to rescue production systems, because of very deep knowledge (both IT and domain 
specific) and system thinking. Loves to share knowledge and experience.
