Paige is passionate about efficiency and building great systems that work. Outside of tech she loves all things crafty and cute, coffee, and cats Rocky and Norman.

Last year Page spoke at DevOpsDays PDX [Disposable Infrastructure: You Only Build Me Up To Tear Me Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz6dfXhvYaY) 
and since then she has been marinating thinking about what her next talk would be about 
and she made the switch to backend engineering which has given her lots of talk 
inspiration.
