Franziska Bühler works as a Systems Engineer for the Swiss Post, where she builds and
enhances the reverse proxy platform in a DevOps manner. Her main areas of responsibility
are web server security and everything related to the access layer. In addition to
building or reorganizing platforms, she also writes and implements security policies. She
writes scripts and programs to automatically rebuild and test the platform every night and
to monitor policy compliance.

In her spare time Franziska Bühler likes to read technical books about security, DevOps or
HTTP. If she is not reading, she disassembles highly optimized regular expressions as
described in [her blogpost](https://coreruleset.org/20171109/disassembling-sqli-rules/).
Or she helps as a developer and committer to enhance the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set.
The Core Rule Set is a rule set for the ModSecurity web application firewall. See
https://coreruleset.org.
