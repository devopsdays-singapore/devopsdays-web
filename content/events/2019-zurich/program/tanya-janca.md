In a DevOps world everyone performs security work, whether they like it or not.  With a
ratio of 100/10/1 for Development, Operations, and Security, it’s impossible for the
security team alone to get it all done. We must build security into each of “the three
ways”; automating and/or improving efficiency of all security activities, speeding up
feedback loops for security related activities, and providing continuous learning
opportunities in relation to security. While it may sound like the security team needs to
learn to sprint, give feedback, and teach at the same time, the real challenge is creating
a culture that embodies the mindset that security is everybody's job.
