Get a quick intro to the [coding academy for refugees](https://powercoders.org/) by its
founder Christian Hirsig. In Bern and ZÃ¼rich already over 30 students have graduated. They
have found their way back to IT in a 13 week program and all found an internship company.
The first ones are already hired and are now independent from social welfare. The IT
industry jumped in with mentors and coaches who where allowed to get involved in the
program on company time and they were providing the internships.

From Christian you will learn learn how you can help to support refugees in Switzerland to
make their way back in to IT.
