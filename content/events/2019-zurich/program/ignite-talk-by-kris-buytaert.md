Infrastructure as Code has been a native open source innovation happening over the past
decade, with languages such as Puppet and Chef growing fast ops folks have been adopting
development practices to run their infrastructures. In the mean time the operations people
together with the developers ran into the limitations of traditional CI platforms where a
lot of “Dirty Clicking” was the norm , creating a pipeline for a stack, or new project was
a boring manual experience.

This is exactly what we tried to get rid of of ther past couple of years from an
infrastructure point of view.

So allow me to introduce the solution to this, Pipeline as Code.
