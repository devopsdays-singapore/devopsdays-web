While Agile development is largely considered the norm in development circles, there are still those to whom it is a mystery, mostly by the less technical people in the community. In this presentation I will offer a friendly and non-tech accessible way to explain Agile to your colleagues who may be struggling to understand why we do what we do, and I’ll do it all without talking about sprints or user stories, instead I’ll talk about Santa Claus and Lego Star Wars.
