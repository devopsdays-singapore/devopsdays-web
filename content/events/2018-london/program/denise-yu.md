Title = "Partition Recovery Patterns: A comparative analysis explained through illustration"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["denise-yu"]
+++

When choosing persistent data stores for your distributed system, it is important to understand how particular products trade off consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. This talk will begin with a refresher of the CAP theorem and its relevance to architecting modern software systems, then proceed with a whistle-stop tour of 2-3 popular open-source data products (ie. RabbitMQ, Kafka, Cassandra â€” final line-up TBD), their comparative design priorities, and suggestions for how they can effectively be utilised for production workloads. All technical explanations will occur in the form of original sketchnote-style illustrations, with the possibility of some live-sketching!
