Kate has been breaking and fixing things at the Guardian all across the stack for the last two years. After developing a tragic love of GDPR, she spent the last six months focused on data security and GDPR compliance. Along with developing new tools, she has also been closely involved in fostering cross-team collaboration and adoption of tools and security best practices.

When Kate is not tinkering with AWS, she can be found writing mediocre JavaScript, advocating for online security and privacy, and slowly amassing enough Raspberry Pis to take over the world.

Beyond tech, Kate will happily discuss martial arts, medical devices, and her fantastic vegan baking.
