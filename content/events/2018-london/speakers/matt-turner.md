Matt is a Solution Engineer at Jetstack, a kubernetes consultancy. He leads Jetstack's Istio projects and spends a lot of time using Kubernetes as well. He was previously a Principal Engineer in the devops department at Skyscanner. He has spoken at several conferences and meetups on subjects from filesystem internals to Scrum, and is a co-organiser of the Istio London meetup.

Matt has been a software engineer for 10 years, following a degree in Computer Science. He started with embedded systems, moved to development tools, then orchestrated VMs for Cisco. Most recently at Skyscanner, he introduced Kubernetes and cloud-native practices. His idea of "full-stack" is POSIX, Kubernetes, and now Istio.
