Denise works at Pivotal Cloud Foundry, packaging open-source data projects such as RabbitMQ and Redis in wrappers (aka BOSH releases) so Cloud Foundry app developers can use them as backing data stores for their applications. Over the last two years, she has been working with the Cloud Foundry Services API, helping to build a unified experience for provisioning and managing on-demand database instances. Denise has previously delivered conference talks on topics ranging from continuous delivery to functional programming to scaling company culture. She enjoys learning about distributed systems, release engineering, and low-level Linux kernel programming.
