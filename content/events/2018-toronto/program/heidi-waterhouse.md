We’ll use this format to explore how feature flags can work with CI/CD or other rapid deployment models, and how we can work to make deployments safer and faster incrementally.

Audiences will get a fun, fast-paced exploration of forking deployments. They’ll walk away with an understanding of how to reduce the risk of major changes, how to follow multiple streams of deployment, and how to evaluate the best way to speed deployment in their environments.

This really is a dynamic, audience driven presentation. They’ll select branching options, and I’ll create the talk on the fly based on pre-determined options. As such, it’s going to be hard to show you the outline. Topics I intend to cover include feature flags, scaled deployments, and kill switches.
