As individuals and organizations get tactical and start looking at specific capabilities to build and practices to embrace, the problem quickly becomes ‘How do I do all of this?’ and ‘Where do I get started?’. One aspect of this problem is how to create room for continuous improvement alongside supporting BAU, and the other is how do you prioritize and manage continuous improvement initiatives against each other. While improving something is better than not improving anything at all, it’s important to demonstrate quick wins to build momentum and get others excited about the DevOps journey. This talk explores into the various ways of prioritizing DevOps initiatives and helps answer questions like ‘Which problem should I focus on fixing?’, ‘Which capability should I build first?’, and ‘Which application team should I pick as pilot?’
