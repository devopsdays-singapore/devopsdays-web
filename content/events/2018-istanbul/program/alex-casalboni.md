Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) help developers automate the software release process. The faster you can release new features and fix bugs, the quicker you can innovate and respond to customer needs. Serverless computing has changed the game for application development, including how to properly perform CI/CD for your application. In this session, we will discuss a reference architecture for orchestrating the deployment of serverless applications running on AWS in a fully secure and automated fashion, using techniques such as canary deployments and automatic rollbacks.
