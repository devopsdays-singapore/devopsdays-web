Suit or shirt, tea or coffee, cloud or on premise. Our whole life is a combination of
conscious and subconscious decisions. They can be made through either an intuitive or
reasoned process, or a combination of the two. Independent from the level of difficulty we
fall victim to the same cognitive and personal biases. Especially personal and cultural
decisions are sometimes hard to make, cause the establishment and enumeration of the
underlying criteria is hard.

The technological developments of the last decade have made poor decision making easier,
more immediate, and more widely consequential. A good understanding of your decision
making process and well known biases helps you to make better judgment. That said the talk
will give you a psychology overview about the process of decision making and common
pitfalls. It will share some tricks to make the right choices and cases of invaluable weak
criteria.
