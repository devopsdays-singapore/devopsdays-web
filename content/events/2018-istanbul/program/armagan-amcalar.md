“Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”

— Melvin Conway, 1967

Microservices is an architectural shift, a huge topic that demands change in every aspect of software delivery. It is also more than a technical problem — your microservices architecture can be as solid and efficient as your team communication. In fact, microservices is not an architectural choice at all. It’s a way dictated by the psychology of your team. It’s a power struggle and it’s guided by the behavioral patterns of the people who implement it – the Generation Y.

This talk describes the human aspect of implementing a microservices approach, and how this affects team communication.
