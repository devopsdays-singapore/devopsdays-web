Chaos! Despair! That was the scenario at Multiportal in 2012. Different versions in different customer environments. A nobody’s land, it was like the wild west. But then come’s to the rescue, the DevOps philosophy, to save us from the despair. Now, peace and calm rules, with CICD and plannings.

In 2012, a small company in Brazil was dealing with a chaotic, but a very common scenario, the lack of software development process. Lots of different customer environments, lots of different versions and different services running like crazy. Constant outage and customer complaints dictate the daily basis of developers.

That was the scenario when I joined the company. It was hell, but as the majority of the small companies around the globe, they always think processes exist just to make everybody`s life miserable and prefer to continue without it.

But some time later, and I have to admit, it took us a lot of time, we realized that some processes were needed to save us from despair.

### All for One and One for All

Like the old story about 3 guys that fight for what is right, our small, but bold dev team started to change the way we used to work, adopting some processes and we started to shape some order to the chaos. It was hard and took us 2 long years to do so. But now we succeeded. As the DevOps mentality usually teach us, it`s better to work together, as a real team, than separating inside our silos and blaming each other. So we started to discuss what we can do to help each other.

### Automation, Automation and Automation

Humans are prone to error, especially if we deal with repetitive tasks. We got lazy and we stop to pay attention to this tasks, and all of a sudden, something blows up. To stop this behavior, we automated a lot of things, and now we have a mature process to guide us through this dark and deep space of software development.

### Small but strong as a rock

Usually, people tend to think that DevOps is a thing for huge corporations, but this is a big lie, even in a small project that you have only your both hands as an asset, you can apply it, and if you would like to learn how we applied it to a 6 person team, join me at this talk.
