Imagine secrets management that is seamless to use by developers, easy to deploy and maintain for operations, and reduces risk for security. In this hands on demo, learn how CyberArk Conjur Open Source can help abstract secrets management from developers while providing strong machine identity, authorization, and authentication that doesnâ€™t disrupt flow or velocity. Even if secrets management is not your problem, it could become your problem if someone else decides to use a solution that disrupts your workflow. You should attend this demo to proactively select a solution that will not impact you. Docker is required for this demo if you want to be hands on or you can just listen and watch. You will get an API key to use Conjur Open Source.
