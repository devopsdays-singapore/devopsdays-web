There's no one-size-fits-all strategy for production observability, just like there's no single correct production architecture, or database schema. In this talk, we'll show how you can incrementally develop a structured logging and instrumentation API that works for your organization, and helps you solve the problems that you care about.

Using extensive code examples, we'll talk about strategies for keeping things simple, so that you can focus on solving business problems instead of prematurely scaling logging, metrics and tracing infrastructure.
