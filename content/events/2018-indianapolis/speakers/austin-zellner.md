Austin Zellner is paid to babble about technology, and has worn all the
hats through the years.  Chased out of the server room, long nights
writing code, and ultimately working on commercial grade projects, he
finally moved from doing tech to talking tech, and has been a sales
engineer ever since.  Living on coffee and white boards, Austin focuses
on breaking complex topics down to their fundamental truths, so that
their beauty and utility can be understood.  With the official title of
"MongoDB Senior Solutions Architect for Ohio Valley Region", Austin
enjoys speaking and working with teams to maximize their investment in
MongoDB.
