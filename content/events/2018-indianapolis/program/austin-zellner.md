Understanding how all the pieces of an engine come together lets you
understand "right thought" when approaching it, how it should work, and
where things might be broken when it doesn't work.  This ignite talk
will lay out a working mental model for MongoDB, so DevOps folk can
understand how best to approach it and understand all the different
components work together.
