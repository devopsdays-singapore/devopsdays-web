Discuss deployment changes (Elastic Beanstalk – original) to Jenkins and
AWS Services (Cloud Formation, Service Catalog). Discussion on toolsets
leveraged such as Puppet, Salt, and Ansible. Results of DevOps

infrastructure consistency from Development, Test to Production. DevOps
initiatives also resulted in improved security stance, cost improvement
and global expansion.
