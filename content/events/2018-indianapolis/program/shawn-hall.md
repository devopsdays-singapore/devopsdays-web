Tight deadlines and an extraordinarily complex mission critical project
needed help and fast. Recognizing at the inception of the project that
the only way to successfully get through this project was to automate as
much repetitive workload as humanly possible. We needed our project team
focused on building new capabilities for our customer and not getting
bogged down with what would normally be a very time consuming task. The
deliverable was a preconfigured virtual machine that was going to need
to be built, tested and scanned many times over during the development
cycle. The problem staring us directly in the face was that there were
many components of the solution that fed into the build process of this
server and they all needed to converge into one single deliverable. By
using automation and continuous integration practices we were able to
construct an automated process that allowed us to reliably and
repeatably build the project deliverable in less than 20 minutes. In
this talk we will cover the technical aspects of how we accomplished
this as well as describing how this solution ultimately contributed to
the overall success of the project.
