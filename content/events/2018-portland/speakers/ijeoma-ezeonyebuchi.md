Ijeoma currently works as a Mobile Quality Assurance Engineer at NPR validating mobile applications and the backend services that power them. Outside of work you can often find her mentoring women in tech as a Java/Android Lab Lead for Women Who Code DC or volunteering. For fun you can find her spending time with those she cares for most(family and friends). Fun fact she just started playing guitar!
