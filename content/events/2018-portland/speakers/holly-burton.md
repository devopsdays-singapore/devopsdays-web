Holly is a leadership coach for women in male-dominated industries. She works one-on-one with ambitious women to help them lead, get promoted, and create the careers they actually want in industries they love.

As a mining engineer for the first ten years of her career, Holly was exposed to one of the most male-dominated spaces  -- just 17% female. She uses the unique perspective she gained as a woman in mining, alongside her obsessive nerdiness for all things feminism, leadership, and career to help women create the working world they deserve while they wait for the rest of society to catch up.

Fun fact: She has the world's coolest business cards.
