Scenario: As Manager of Development Enablement, you have taken ownership of dev tools that have sustained a 9.0 Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake, aka communal ownership while the engineering org scales. How does one assess the damage and do the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest time? Good thing Dev Enablement has a lot in common with volunteer community-based emergency first responder teams! Both employ strategies of architectural damage assessment, emergency triage and prioritized resource allocation in order to respond to big disasters involving critical infrastructure. Find out how Neighborhood Emergency Team training can help you rescue your Build, CI and CD tooling!
