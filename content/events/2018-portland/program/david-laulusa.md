As we try to shrink cycle times where does QA fit in this new paradigm? Are they the ugly step children that are left in the kitchen to eat only after development has finished the feast? And what of the start up that probably doesn't even have QA?

This talk is aimed mainly at the Development and Operations folks who will have to wear the QA hat. We’ll talk of strategies that we can employ in order to inject quality earlier in the process. Actually, that’s a lie. You can’t inspect quality into a product. But we will go over some good habits as we test earlier in the development process. And at the end, we’ll have a little test.
