When I first started my new gig they had a problem - ~2000 hosts pulling many gigabytes a day from S3 was starting to add up and slow things down. There were many fixes discussed, but in the end using OSS and only minor changes to the code base and the infrastructure were needed. In the end we saved about $10,000 a month per colo and our ability to ship business logic rules went from minutes to seconds.
