With the constant demand to build systems rapidly with more resiliency and less budget, compounded with on-call support duties and a seemingly endless stream of alerts, it’s no wonder that burnout has become a serious problem within the DevOps community.

In 2016, I had a friend who went through a serious burnout crisis and I didn’t know how to help. That experience prompted me to get trained and certified in mental health first aid.

In this session, I’ll share ways that you can identify burnout and action steps to prevent yourself from burning out. But more importantly, because we are a DevOps community, I’ll share a framework from mental health first aid that will help you identify, help and support others experiencing burnout and mental health issues.
