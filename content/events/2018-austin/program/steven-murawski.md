In early 2010, Visual Studio Team Foundation Server was on-premises, boxed software.  It shipped every two to three years.  Today, Visual Studio Team Services is an online platform serving millions of accounts, deploying bug fixes on demand, and shipping new features every three weeks.  Join me on the journey from boxed software to a highly-available continually evolving service using feature flags, deployment rings, testing-in-production, and more.  Not only will we cover the cool, fun patterns, but we'll dip into the pitfalls and challenges experienced.
