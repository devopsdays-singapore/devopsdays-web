I have developed an infrastructure that provides automated audit of Network Configuration (Cisco, Arista and Juniper routers and switches) using Ansible and Jenkins. The audit is based on building a Golden configuration for the devices using Ansible and comparing the Golden configuration against active configuration in the network producing a context-sensitive result. A network-wide audit completes in less than 10 minutes using Jenkins, where the Jenkins jobs are also managed by software (JJB) and source controlled. Any differences attributed to Out-of-band changes or configuration modeling errors can either be played back to the devices or used to update the configuration modeling, respectively. This utility is being used by ViaSatâ€™s Networking devops team to automate building and management of device configuration.
