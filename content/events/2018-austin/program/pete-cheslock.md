If you ask ten people to define DevOps, you’ll likely get a dozen different answers. Somehow it’s 2018 and we still can’t agree on what DevOps is, only what it looks like. Many companies want all the benefits from DevOps without making any changes to their organization. The truth is that successful DevOps implementations require hard work over long periods of time.

DevOps at Threat Stack is a survival mechanism. We need to be lean and innovative or we’ll simply not exist as a business. When I say DevOps, I’m not talking about using Chef or deploying to AWS. I’m talking about optimizing early for the behaviors we wanted as an ops organization working with software developers. We focused on these efforts to get everyone working towards the same shared goals. We work to lower the risk of change through both the tools we created AND the culture we grew.

This is a story in 3 Acts. Each Act leads into the next one, the results compound the impact to the team. How We Engineer for Rapid Change Optimizing for Visibility Building Accountable Engineers

In this session, you will learn how Threat Stack turns ideas into reality, quickly and safely. We’ll go over how we design our telemetry system to support useful, actionable metrics and the steps we take to level up our engineers, giving them the ownership and accountability to own the applications they build. We’ll share what produced good results, what generated more trouble than it was worth, and what concrete ideas you can take back to improve how work gets done within your organization.
