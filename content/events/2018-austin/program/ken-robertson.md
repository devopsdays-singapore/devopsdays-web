At Coinbase, we maintain a high standard for security and operational readiness. In line with this, we've been working on having a better way to have a regular process for major updates, while still allowing us to do tightly controlled incremental updates to be reactive for critical updates. This has been implemented as a toolkit we call Minion, which allows us to define a base operating system derived from Gentoo and CoreOS. In this talk, I will cover how we manage our operational environment at Coinbase between our infrastructure and security teams, how we wanted to improve the process, and where we plan to take it in the future.
