"Pull Requests Welcome." A phrase to indicate you're open to community contribution, but it does nothing to help bring high-quality contribution quickly. Contributors have to ramp up in your code base, may not have a great test suite, etc. What steps can we take to enable that process?

This is the story of enabling easy, quality contributions for Elastic Beats. Our Beats project runs in unpredictable environments so we wanted our community to be able to build extensions for their needs as easily as possible.

Attendees will learn how we:

* Designed for customization
* Built Documentation into the code
* Reduce repetitive work
* Enable local testing with minimal effort
* Allow for sharing back to the larger community
