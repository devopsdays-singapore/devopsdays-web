Traditionally DevOps has been used for application software with stable OS/Simulation SW. We will take an abstract look at how DevOps was implemented for Embedded Software when development for the low-level APIs and Application/Test Development is taking place in parallel with Simulation Platform development. We will talk about some of the challenges faced and talk about a solution. Lastly, we will talk about the preparation and design steps to allow for DevOps with HW in the loop.
