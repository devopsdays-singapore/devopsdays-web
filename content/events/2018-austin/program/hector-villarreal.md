It all started with the best of intentions back in 2015. We wanted to do what was 'right': Infrastructure as code and an automated way to do deployments with a microservices architecture. A lot of work was done and decisions that were made at that time allowed us to accomplish those goals in record time... more or less. Three years later, we've outgrown that initial systemand a lot of decisions that were made with good intentions are hindering our growth today. In this session we'll talk about the lessons learned and what we're doing today to fix it.
