Over the course of 2017, Coinbase experienced exponential user and trading volume growth, which in turn led to periods of website instability and downtime. To address these issues, Coinbase put together a specialized ""Uptime Team"" to focus on responding to incidents and improving reliability so that the rest of the company could continue to operate.

This talk will focus on our learnings throughout this experience and how we've leveraged them to build a new Site Reliability Team from scratch.
