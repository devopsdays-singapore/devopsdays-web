Think of Marie Curie. Would you expect to find a fascinating number of similarities between the Curie's treatment of their work in the early 1900's and today's tech industry?  I certainly didn'tâ€¦ Join Mandy Whaley to explore how the Curie's used an approach similar to modern Open Source licensing to open the process for isolating radium to the scientific community, and how the limitations at the time on the rights of women to own intellectual property influenced this decision.  Also, learn how Marie Curie also used a strategy similar to Kickstarter to raise funds to buy radium for her own research, and how all of these experiences and lessons can help us today.
