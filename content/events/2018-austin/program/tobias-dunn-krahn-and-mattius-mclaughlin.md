Like many modern development organizations, xMatters has been hard at work decomposing a monolithic application into many microservices.  With this effort comes more autonomy for service-owning teams, but also more responsibilities.  Tobias Dunn-Krahn and Mattius McLaughlin will talk about how their organization has transformed to face the challenge, as well as how to promote service ownership, balance operational concerns with feature velocity using SLIs/SLOs and avoiding callout fatigue.
