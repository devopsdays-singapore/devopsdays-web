Title = "Kubernetes 201: You have Kubernetes up and running, now what?"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["victor-trac"]

There are lots of guides and talks about getting Kubernetes installed and running, but there isn't a lot of information about logical next steps. This is a practical talk that covers common next steps like setting up access controls, metrics, logging, and more, based on experience running Kubernetes in production at multiple companies. This talk assumes a basic understanding of what Kubernetes is and some familiarity of Kubernetes resources.
