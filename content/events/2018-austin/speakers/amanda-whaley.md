Mandy Whaley is Director of Developer Experience & Developer Advocacy for Cisco DevNet. She spends most of her time thinking about how developers outside and inside of Cisco use Cisco APIs, and about how to make their job easier. She leads a team of developer advocates who work with Cisco partners and developers in many technology areas including IoT, Collaboration, and Network Automation.

Mandy is interested in all things that help developers build cool stuff - tools, APIs, docs, frameworks. She is also a mom of two boys, a novice drummer, and you can often find her on the mountain biking trails in her hometown of Austin, TX.
