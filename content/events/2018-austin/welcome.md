### Why the Summit Format for 2018?

DevOpsDays Austin 2018 is our **7th** in the ATX. We have some changes in store this year!

Last year we brought you "Monsters of DevOps" that included all the DevOps VIPs we could pull down (including the first time all 4 authors of the DevOps Handbook managed to get together at an event). We also had multiple content tracks, killer swag, great food, a hackathon, and an amazing Happy Hour. Local user groups were invited in to give talks.

We have been getting bigger each year, continually focusing on introducing new people to DevOps. This year we have decided to go back in time and recreate an experience where the focus is on the **interaction between highly driven participants**.

### What is the Summit Format?

This year DevOpsDays Austin is going to a summit format. What does this mean?

* Reduction in size of the event. Fewer tickets sold.
* More focus on local, motivated practitioners.
* No sponsor tables. Sponsors will participate just like other participants.
* No preselected talks (except maybe a keynote or two). Speakers submit talks, but participants vote on day 1 which talks they want to hear.
* Openspaces will be highly engaged discussions like they used to be.
* Attendees are expected to engage and share, not just passively listen.
* No live streaming.

### Come on Down!

We'd love to see everyone out at DevOpsDays Austin 2018!  Come ready to interact and share.  Come ready to give a talk, with the risk it won't be selected by your peers. Come sponsor your company, you just won't have a table to lounge at. This change has gotten us excited about running our seventh DevOpsDays, and we bet you'll love it!
