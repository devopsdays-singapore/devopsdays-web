Ben Hartshorne is an engineer at Honeycomb. For the last 12 years, Ben has built monitoring, alerting, and observability systems for companies ranging from startups like Simply Hired and Parse to large organizations such as Wikimedia and Facebook. Strangely, he actually enjoys this work and is happy to finally be building a company that will help tease out nuances in data that seem to be missing from our current toolsets.
