Tim Gross is founder of Machinist Labs, an independent consultancy in DevOps mentoring, training, and software architecture. Tim has done everything from designing PKI infrastructure for IoT, to writing open source projects for building self-assembling distributed systems, to running ops at DramaFever, where he and his scrappy team served millions of fans their daily dose of dramas, documentaries, and gross-out horror movies. In another life, Tim was an architect (buildings, not software). He took the leap into technology after he discovered he could automate away almost everything boring in his life.
