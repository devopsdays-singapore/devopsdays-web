Interns: you love them, you hate them, you’ve been them, you’ve trained them. DevOps is a particularly difficult field to handle interns due to its fast pace and constantly shifting tech landscape. Presented by a former intern, this talk is a walkthrough of ways to help your intern understand your pipeline, tooling, and culture. It will cover common roadblocks, resources for beginners, and how to not “break your intern”. Mentors are welcome to learn how to help their interns succeed, and interns are welcome to gain insight and solidarity in panicking about Docker.
