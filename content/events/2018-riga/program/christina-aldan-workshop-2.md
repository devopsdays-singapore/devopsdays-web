<p>Recent discoveries in neuroplasticity of the brain give designers, developers, and marketers more insight into the motivations of consumers and how Emotional Intelligence (EQ) influences decisions. We must see the world from other perspectives and understand the key feelings supporting consumers choices. In this workshop, learn how to cultivate Emotional Intelligence, examples of companies that are doing it right, and how to consider EQ into the design, development, and marketing of your products. Workshop is lead by Christina Aldan, TEDx speaker, trainer, and digital advertising consultant.</p>
