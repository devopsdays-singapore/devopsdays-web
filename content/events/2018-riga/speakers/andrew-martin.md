<h3>Co-founder at <a href="https://control-plane.io" target ="_blank">ControlPlane</a></h3>

<p>Andrew Martin has a strong test-first engineering ethos gained architecting and deploying high-traffic web applications. Proficient in systems development, testing, and maintenance, he is comfortable profiling and securing every tier of a bare metal or cloud native application, and has battle-hardened experience delivering containerised solutions to enterprise clients. He is a co-founder at <a href="https://control-plane.io" target ="_blank">ControlPlane</a></p>

<p>"How secure is Kubernetes? Can we really run Google-style multi tenanted infrastructure safely? And how can we be sure what we configured yesterday will be in place tomorrow?" These questions are going to be answered by Andrew during his talk in Riga.</p>
